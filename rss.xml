Access to a positive and productive experience that provides an alternative to anti-social activity. A fun and engaging framework to develop trust, teamwork, leadership, self-confidence, creative self-expression, a sense of responsibility and commitment, and improved social skills. Opportunities to develop and express creativity and to share cultural stories as well as personal ideas, emotions and experiences with others. A better understanding of the potential that music and physical movement can offer as outlets for self-expression. Opportunities to develop new, portable skills in dance and other creative practices, reaffirming the studentâ€™s learning capacity, creativity and imagination. A dynamic, energising and motivating experience, developing a sense of responsibility, respect, self-worth, commitment and achievement. Renewed interest and engagement with school and the community, improving both educational outcomes and social cohesion. A voice, acknowledged presence and recognition in a positive context, both privately and publicly.

Improved awareness of alternative options for self expression and engagement with others. Improved skills across a broad range of areas.

Decreased costs to welfare, public health and the justice system. Improved skills development for emerging youth leaders and social innovators, improving communication across community and government sectors to generate future youth relevant programming and activities.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/98c8523401f31f4f188ea05406749048/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=1366&cropwidth=2048&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F45571b3f-6c3a-4618-a091-254156146e01.jpg&x=0&y=0"></article>]]></description>
