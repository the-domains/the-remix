  THE REMIX PROGRAM MODULES:  Project 1 : Dance Workshop Program  A 12 week
  series of collaborative, guided dance workshops, which draw structure from our
  professional level ‘In-Schools Dance Program’ and inspiration from the
  students themselves. Workshops are tailored to the interests, experience and
  talents of the students involved, in order to motivate active participation.
  The workshops culminate in THE REMIX event - a professionally-produced dance
  competition and performance showcase at a major public venue, which provides
  participating students with the opportunity to perform in a prestigious
  performance environment alongside professional dancers. This celebration of
  achievement is bolstered after the event by opportunity signposting and
  networking for students who may wish to further their training or pursue a
  professional dance career. Project 2 : A Local Community Production  A
  complement to the Dance Workshop Project, the Production project empowers
  students with the skills required to initiate, plan, promote and present their
  dance creations within their local community. This may, for example, involve
  performances within the school, ‘Random Acts of Dance’ (such as community
  event or community facility performances, or flashmobs), or the creation of
  performance videos for sharing on social media.  Project 3 : Mash-Up Skills
  Development  Young people and schools with advanced skills or interest in a
  particular creative art form are mentored to create Dance Fusion performances,
  to be presented at THE REMIX event. Mash-Up performances may combine elements
  of hip hop, digital media, traditional instruments and live music, including
  cultural fusions. Students are encouraged to think creatively and to
  proactively collaborate with non-dancers, to ensure the event is both unique
  and inclusive.

## **WHAT DOES THE REMIX PROGRAM ENTAIL**

**THE REMIX PROGRAM MODULES: **  
**Project 1 : Dance Workshop Program **  
A 12 week series of collaborative, guided dance workshops, which draw structure from our professional level 'In-Schools Dance Program' and inspiration from the students themselves. Workshops are tailored to the interests, experience and talents of the students involved, in order to motivate active participation.   
The workshops culminate in **THE REMIX** event - a professionally-produced dance competition and performance showcase at a major public venue, which provides participating students with the opportunity to perform in a prestigious performance environment alongside professional dancers.   
This celebration of achievement is bolstered after the event by opportunity signposting and networking for students who may wish to further their training or pursue a professional dance career.   
**Project 2 : A Local Community Production **  
A complement to the Dance Workshop Project, the Production project empowers students with the skills required to initiate, plan, promote and present their dance creations within their local community. This may, for example, involve performances within the school, 'Random Acts of Dance' (such as community event or community facility performances, or flashmobs), or the creation of performance videos for sharing on social media.   
**Project 3 : Mash-Up Skills Development **  
Young people and schools with advanced skills or interest in a particular creative art form are mentored to create Dance Fusion performances, to be presented at **[THE REMIX][0]** event. Mash-Up performances may combine elements of hip hop, digital media, traditional instruments and live music, including cultural fusions. Students are encouraged to think creatively and to proactively collaborate with non-dancers, to ensure the event is both unique and inclusive.

**Who is involved?**

**THE REMIX** program participants are high school students (from public schools, private schools, alternative education and re-engagement programs) and other young people in the geographic area of the program's local government partners (who contribute funding).   
The program is co-ordinated by Creative Producer Rebecca Morrison and her team, who liaise closely with staff from participating schools. The program also employs a range of professional arts workers and engages with community volunteers across a range of disciplines. 

**When?**  
Program delivery timing may be customised, historically running annually over a workshop period of around 5 months, culminating in the major performance event (called '**THE REMIX**').   
**Where? **  
Workshops are conducted at: High Schools, Community Centres and Alternative Education Facilities. Performances occur at: A major city venue; City and suburban public spaces; High Schools and local Community Centres.   
**How?**  
All Projects are self-sufficient and delivered by **THE REMIX** team, with all necessary Program Management, Event Management, Marketing and Documentation services structured into each activity.

The program can be conducted within school hours or after hours, with class and program duration tailored to best fit. Schools need not divert any teaching resources in order to participate in T**HE REMIX**, and the overall series is structured to create a level playing field for all students regardless of funding differences between schools.   
Participating schools are encouraged to explore the unique opportunities the program presents to build community spirit, stimulate active learning and generate positive fitness outcomes for their students.   
**THE REMIX** team has enjoyed outstanding, demonstrated effectiveness in engaging with marginalised and at-risk students, keeping them in school, and helping pave myriad alternative pathways to success.   
**THE REMIX** program incorporates strong Communication and Project Evaluation policies, enabling Continuous Improvement and Strategic Planning to further refine and develop projects to best fit each community's particular needs and interests.   
**Why? **  
An investment in your community, paying exceptional dividends. **The Remix** has a proven track record in delivering desirable social, cultural and economic outcomes, with both immediate and sustainable long-term impact, for participating students, schools, and the broader community.
